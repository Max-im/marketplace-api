**Task: Build a Basic Peer-to-Peer Rental Platform Backend**

**Create a backend API for a platform where users can rent out items (e.g., tools, books, or gadgets). The API should support the following:**

- [x]  **List an Item: Add items available for rent, including details like item name, description, price per day, and availability.**
- [ ] **Search Items: Retrieve a list of available items filtered by name or price range.**
- [ ] **Rent an Item: Mark an item as rented for a specific date range.**
- [ ] **Return an Item: Mark the item as returned and make it available again.**


- **Handle overlapping rental dates (e.g., prevent conflicts).**
- **Write a README with clear instructions on how to test the API.**
